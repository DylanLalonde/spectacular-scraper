Need to find:
    Missing video - will just check if contains video, then view video manually.
    Broken content links
    Missing "Related"


Solution is to make 4 different programs.

Each program takes a list of urls in a csv as input, checks each url for different 
issues, and then logs the needed information in the correct columns in the csv output.


1. Missing video:

Checks if #contentMain contains .mediastack--video.


2. Broken content links:

    1st program (create json containing each article's links):

        Checks if each .article-section>.article-section-content>p within #contentMain 
        contains an a (link). Each link then gets added to a json file like this:
            {
                "story_url": "examplestory.com",
                "story_links": [
                    "exampleexternmallink1.com",
                    "exampleexternmallink2.com",
                    "/example/internal/link1",
                    "/example/internal/link2"
                ]
            }

    2nd program (check each link in json, log if broken in csv):


3. Missing "Related":

Simply checks if the dom contains .field--name-field-relevancy-points.
